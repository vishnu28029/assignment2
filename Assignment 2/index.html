             Hello! My name is Vishnu.I am a passionate web developer student who enjoys creating simple, clean, and responsive websites. This personal portfolio showcases my learning journey, skills, and projects as I continue to grow in web development. I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly exploring new techniques to improve my designs and coding skills. I believe in learning by doing and aim to build user-friendly websites with a strong focus on clarity and creativity.

                As a beginner, my goal is to gain real-world experience, enhance my
        technical knowledge, and build meaningful digital solutions while
